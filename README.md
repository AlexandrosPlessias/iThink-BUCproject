# iThink-BUCproject
I use iThink 9.0.2 programme, a Premium modeling and interactive simulations for creating a business plan for my project B.U.C. within Entrepreneurship in Informatics lesson.

The B.U.C. (Braille Unflagging Converter) project is aimed primarily at blind people, people with severe vision problems and people in their immediate environment. It is essentially a natural language converter (any, but initially pilot only for Greek) in Braille which will use the BUC Displayer (tablet), which has various holes from which the boards come in and out and form the corresponding phrases in code Braille and touch will be able to be read by blind people and will also have a built-in voice reading program in case the user presses the corresponding panels loudly and supports 3G-WIFI-GPS protocols. All book titles for the BUC Displayer will be available exclusively from the BUC Store and in the future in the big App Markets (Android, Apple). * It was created as part of a course as a fantastic technology product *
